ChatGPT-4o was used alongside the slides to expand our knowledge of certain topics, and improve the code. We also used it to help resolve bugs we came across during development. Many issues were addressed successfully.
ChatGPT-4o was also utilized as a helpful resource to assist in creating basic CSS styling for this project.
